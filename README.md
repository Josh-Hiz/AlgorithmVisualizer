# Algorithm Visualizer
## Algorithms:
- Selection Sort
- Brick/EvenOdd Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Shell Sort (IN PROGRESS)
- Gnome Sort

## How to use and notes about usage:
Java JButton's are a buggy mess, and when scrambling rectangles during the sort, it can "hide" the sort button, but will reveal itself when your cursor is over it and will begin the sort visualization, to change what type of sort, just go into the *ArrayVisualizer* class and scroll to the botton and choose any of the sort variables presented near the top of the class as they all have the same method name *sortWithDelay*. Have fun.
